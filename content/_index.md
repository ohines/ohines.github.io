I am a data scientist working at [Quantco](https://www.quantco.com/) on health insurance and pricing projects.
Before joining Quantco I completed a PhD in Biostatistics under the supervision of [Karla Diaz-Ordaz](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/78115-karla-diaz-ordaz) and [Stijn Vansteelandt](https://users.ugent.be/~svsteela/) at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/).
My [thesis](/thesis) concerned theoretical methods for using machine learning to answer causal and statistical questions under minimal assumptions.
Over my career I have worked on statistical projects in the fields of epidemiology, genetics, economics, and finance, and I have enjoyed learning about the challenges of each domain.
