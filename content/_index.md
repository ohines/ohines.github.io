I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Columbia University](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/) working on topics in nonparametric statistics, machine learning, and causal inference. Before joining Columbia I worked for [Quantco](https://www.quantco.com/) on health insurance and pricing projects, and completed a PhD in Biostatistics at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/).
